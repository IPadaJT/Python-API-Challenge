# python-api-challenge
- This module assignment asks us to use the Geoapify and OpenWeather API to create two separate projects
## Part 1: WeatherPy 
- This challenge asks us to use the OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve weather data and create several scatter plots of Latitude vs (1) Temperature, (2) Humidity, (3) Cloudiness, (4) Wind Speed.
- Then compute a linear regression and add it to the respective scatter plots
## Part 2: VacationPy 
- This challenge asks us to use the weather data gathered to help create map plots that can make planning vacations a little easier
- By reading a .csv of the WeatherData gathered from WeatherPy and refining the dataframe into our ideal vacation conditions, we must use Geoapify's API to find the nearest hotel in our ideal vacation spots.
- These are then added into the map plots made earlier on in VacationPy.
